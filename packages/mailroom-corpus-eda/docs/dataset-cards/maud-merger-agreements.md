## Full context

**MAUD v1** (Merger Agreement Understanding Dataset) is an expert-annotated
corpus of 152 public-company merger agreements from The Atticus Project,
carrying **47,000+ expert labels** across 22 classification tasks organized
into four categories — Conditions to Closing, Covenants, No-Shop / FTR, and
Definitions. The annotation schema operationalizes the ABA 2021 Public
Target Deal Points Study, making MAUD the reference benchmark for
merger-agreement legal reasoning.

In mailroom-dataset the corpus serves as the **long-document stress class**.
Agreement texts were streamed from the Zenodo v1 corpus export; the
consideration-type annotation informs `expected_subclass`, and the upstream
label bookkeeping rides in `metadata.maud_label_count` (individual answer
labels per agreement, 70–244) and `metadata.maud_categories`. The full MAUD
gold labels joined per contract id as `maud_clause_labels` on the
`ground_truth` config (category / answer / valid_classes / label_idx per
task). Every row's `metadata.original_file` points at its upstream
`contract_N.txt` text (MAUD ships no PDFs).

## Purpose in mailroom-dataset

1. **doc_type supervision** — 152 gold `merger_agreement` labels; the
   smallest large-document class, deliberately kept to exercise long-context
   behavior.
2. **Second-level classification** — consideration-type `expected_subclass`
   (all-cash / all-stock / mixed / election / other structures).
3. **Multi-task legal-reasoning GT** — `maud_clause_labels` carries MAUD's
   gold labels across its 22 tasks (category, answer, valid_classes,
   label_idx), joined 152/152 via contract id with metadata consistency
   asserted (`maud_label_count == sum(maud_categories) == upstream count`
   on all 152 rows). Scoring substrate for extraction/eval — never in the
   blind config.
4. **Context-window stress test** — merger agreements are by far the
   longest documents in the corpus and the reason the token-budget coverage
   table has a 131k column.

## Subset statistics (v7 EDA)

- Text length (chars): mean 356,194 · p50 338,188 · p95 497,718 · max
  1,008,540 — roughly **89k tokens mean / ~252k tokens max** at the
  chars/4 heuristic: **exceeds common 32k/65k contexts**; requires 131k+
  context or chunking.
- Task coverage: 3 of the 22 tasks are annotated on every agreement;
  coverage ranges 11–152 documents; mean 16.4 tasks answered per agreement
  (range 11–20) — see
  [`reports/tables/maud_task_stats.csv`](../../reports/tables/maud_task_stats.csv).
- Task-category mix: Deal Protection and Related Provisions dominates
  (no-shop, FTR triggers, fiduciary exceptions); Conditions to Closing
  carries the 100%-coverage Accuracy-of-Target-R&W task.
- Largest stratum is tied: all_cash and other at 57 rows each; the
  mixed_cash_stock_election stratum has a single row (the corpus minimum).

## Caveats & limitations

- 152 agreements is a small class — per-stratum test shares deviate from
  the nominal 10% (17 test rows, 11.2%), and the single
  mixed_cash_stock_election row sits in train with zero test representation.
- Public-target deals only (per the ABA Public Target Deal Points Study
  scope); private-target structures are out of distribution.
- Mean length ~89k tokens means most consumer model contexts cannot ingest
  these rows whole — plan for 131k+ context, retrieval, or chunked scoring;
  see `ml-readiness` recommendations in
  [`reports/SUMMARY_REPORT.md`](../../reports/SUMMARY_REPORT.md).
- MAUD labels are expert but sparse at task level (11–152 docs per task);
  tasks below ~25% coverage are weak supervision targets.
