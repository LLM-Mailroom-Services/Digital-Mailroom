"""Docclass prompt variants for every mailroom classification-chain role.

KANBAN-090 (2026-08-23, human directive via Discord #hermes): mirrors the
llm-entity-extraction docclass prompt arm (``src/prompts_docclass.py`` there).
Every variant here is DERIVED from this repo's own production base — the
exact string in ``llm.prompts.prompt_templates()`` — by PURE APPENDITION.
``variant.startswith(base)`` holds in full, the base bytes are untouched, and
the docclass block rides after the production closer as additive context.
Nothing is replaced, so no production anchor can drift.

DEPLOYMENT: mailroom's Langfuse production surface is the agent-name-pinned
templates in ``prompt_templates()`` (`mailroom-<agent_name>`). Docclass
variants must NEVER flow through prompt_templates(): that would overwrite
production agent prompts. They ship as this standalone registry and reach
Langfuse only via the OPT-IN sync path::

    python scripts/sync_prompts.py --docclass

which pushes them under distinct ``mailroom-docclass-<key>`` names,
content-keyed and idempotent like every other sync. Runtime routes are
untouched: no pipeline fetches a docclass key by default.
