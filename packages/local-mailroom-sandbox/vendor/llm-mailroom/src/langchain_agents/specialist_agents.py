# VENDORED from github.com/Exios66/llm-entity-extraction (re-vendored to the
# sibling's current HEAD, 2026-08-15 — adds the v24+ per-field ``reasoning``
# trace schema and the v15+ chunked-extraction pass since the 3a03d5c pin).
# Imported verbatim (import paths rewritten to ``langchain_agents.*``) so the
# eval-validated LangChain sorter/contracts-specialist agents run inside the
# mailroom. Local adaptations (pages/vision, usage/deadline hooks) are marked
# ``MAILROOM PATCH``. Keep diffs against upstream small and documented.


"""Specialist agents for field extraction from each document type (LangChain).

Each specialist knows how to extract fields specific to its document type and
is driven by a versioned prompt from ``src.prompts``. Schemas are exported as
module constants so the eval loops and judges can reference the same contracts.
