"""P1 coverage matrix (plan §40–§41, HUB-022; issue #28).

The Mailroom corpus coverage report: per document class × subclass stratum —
row counts, source coverage, specialist routing, per-field ground-truth
population (§41: which extraction fields lack meaningful evaluation
coverage) — plus the §40 scenario columns (tested/regression/challenge/
multi-document), which stay at zero until the P2 (matter/grouping) and P3
(recovery) fixture families land. Reads the LOCAL snapshot only
(network-free); mirrors the EDA phase conventions (read-only, no writes
outside docs/reports/audits/).

Issue #28 (epic #27): §41 coverage is reported over **eligible rows only**.
Every unpopulated cell is classified as ``schema_documented_absence`` (the
v8_build/v9 conformance law documents the field empty on this row — e.g.
``adjuster`` on CMS/GNOTHEIA/INSURBIAS rows, ``denial_reasons`` on non-denied
claims) or ``genuine_gap`` (the field should be populated but is not — e.g.
``cuad_clause_labels`` on the 91 EDGAR EX-10 contracts, any
``supporting_documents`` row outside a documented rule). Documented absences
are tallied (``absence_classification`` per class/field + the
``absence_rules`` verification section) but never counted as gaps, so the
matrix no longer mis-scopes closure work on by-design-empty rows.

Usage (via run_all conventions or standalone):
    python scripts/audit/coverage_matrix.py            # write md + json
    python scripts/audit/coverage_matrix.py --check    # print only
