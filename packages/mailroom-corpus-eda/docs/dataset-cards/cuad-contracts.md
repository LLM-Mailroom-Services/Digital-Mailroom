## Full context

**CUAD v1** (Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset) is an expert-annotated
corpus of 510 US commercial contracts curated by The Atticus Project. Each
contract is annotated for 41 clause types — covering parties, dates,
governing law, liability caps, license grants, non-competes and more — with
over 25,000 answer spans total, to support legal contract review by NLP
models. It is the standard benchmark for contract-understanding tasks and
was published at NeurIPS 2021 (Datasets & Benchmarks).

In mailroom-dataset the corpus is the **contract backbone**: every row keeps
CUAD's own commercial-contract grouping as the second-level gold label
(`expected_subclass` — e.g. `Co_Branding`, `Distributor`, `License_Agreements`),
plus the full official clause annotation set on the `ground_truth` config as
`cuad_clause_labels`. The upstream corpus was created with dozens of legal
experts from The Atticus Project and carries over 13,000 annotations across
41 clause types (per the official paper); the 600-row merged subset alone
contributes 13,753 verified answer spans (509 CUAD rows) to the `ground_truth`
config. The
509 rows are a byte-verified export of the
Braintrust CUAD mirror curated as
[`mailroom-cuad-contracts-full`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lucius-Morningstar/mailroom-cuad-contracts-full),
so the docclass surface inherits a sha256-checkable chain back to the
original CUAD distribution. Rows also carry clause counts and
applicable-categories metadata, and every row's `metadata.original_file`
points at its upstream CUAD PDF path (source PDFs ride along under
`files/contract/...` in the Hub tree when staged).

## Purpose in mailroom-dataset

1. **doc_type supervision** — 509 gold `contract` labels (30.8% of the
   corpus), the second-largest class after insurance_claim.
2. **Second-level classification** — `expected_subclass` over 26 commercial
   contract groups gives a fine-grained contract-type head.
3. **Clause-level extraction GT** — `cuad_clause_labels` on the
   `ground_truth` config carries the official CUAD annotation set as compact
   JSON (clause name → `[{text, start}]`): **13,753/13,753 answer spans
   verified at exact char offsets** against the stored `doc_text` (100%
   match, audited in the P1 integrity pass). This is the scoring substrate
   for entity-extraction evaluation — it never appears in the blind config.
4. **Realistic mid-length legal text** — contracts anchor the corpus's
   mid-length tail (median ~33k chars ≈ 8k tokens; 95th percentile ~161k
   chars ≈ 40k tokens), between short correspondence/claims and merger
   agreements.

## Subset statistics (v7 EDA)

- Text length (chars): mean 52,176 · p50 32,861 · p95 161,402 · max 338,211.
- Most-annotated clauses: Document Name (509 contracts, 100%), Parties
  (508, mean 5.0 spans), Agreement Date (469), Governing Law (436),
  Expiration Date (412), Effective Date (389) — see
  [`reports/tables/cuad_clause_stats.csv`](../../reports/tables/cuad_clause_stats.csv).
- 14 of the 41 clause types appear in fewer than 15% of contracts (long-tail
  annotation density).
- Every contract carries annotations (509/509 joined, zero orphans).

## Caveats & limitations

- US commercial contracts, English only; the 28-group taxonomy is CUAD's
  own — 26 groups appear here, so `expected_subclass` is not exhaustive of
  the upstream taxonomy.
- 6 contract subclasses have 12 or fewer rows, and 8 of the 26 (Endorsement,
  Outsourcing, Promotion, Reseller, Consulting Agreements,
  Agency Agreements, Joint Venture _ Filing, Non_Compete_Non_Solicit) drew
  zero test rows under the family split rule — see
  [`reports/tables/strata_counts.csv`](../../reports/tables/strata_counts.csv).
- CUAD's annotations were produced by trained annotators with expert review,
  but clause presence is inherently subjective at the margins; treat
  `cuad_clause_labels` as gold for *span-matching against CUAD's own
  convention*, not as universal legal truth.
