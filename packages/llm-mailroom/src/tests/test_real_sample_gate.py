"""Real (non-mock) pilot runs must only process actual committed legal
documents — the Atticus/CUAD contract & agreement PDFs plus LegalBench MAUD.
Repo-written synthetic .txt samples (render-to-PDF stand-ins under
docs/examples/sources/) are mock-only and must be blocked from every --real
run so no real LLM/eval tokens or live traces are spent on fake documents.
Pile of Law court opinions remain on disk but are not in the live manifest
(court_opinion is no longer a pipeline class).
