# Mailroom — Multi-Agent Legal Document Processing Pipeline

Welcome to the Mailroom wiki.

Mailroom is a multi-agent pipeline that ingests high-volume legal documents, classifies them, routes them to specialist agents for extraction, compiles the results into a matter record, and archives everything with a full, tamper-evident audit trail.

**v1 targets pilot scale** (dozens of documents/day), organized by case/matter, running on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) with a clear path to fully local inference.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Auditability over cleverness** — Every classification, extraction, and routing decision must be traceable.
2. **Explicit over emergent** — Orchestration is a defined LangGraph state machine.
3. **Human-legible state** — Filesystem bins mean anyone can `ls` a folder and understand where a document is.
4. **Provider-agnostic LLM layer** — OpenRouter today, local models later with one config change.
5. **Redundant record-keeping** — The audit trail does not depend on any single tool staying alive.

## Architecture at a Glance

```
Upload/Drop --> /pipeline/inbox/ --> [Watcher] --> LangGraph run per document
                                                        |
              Sorter --> Specialist --> [Judge/Arbiter gate] --> Reporter --> Catalog --> Archivist
                                                        |
                                    Boss (escalation)    Human Review    Audit Log
```

**13 LangGraph nodes** in a state machine (`intake`, `classify`, `retry_classify`, `review_classify`, `extract`, `retry_extract`, `judge_verify`, `arbiter`, `human_review`, `boss_escalation`, `compile_report`, `catalog_write`, `archive`) — including the exception lanes from the architecture-alignment build: an agent second-opinion reviewer for exhausted medium-band classifications (Lane A) and a gated judge→arbiter completeness-verification path for grounded extractions (Lane B). Checkpointing is in-memory by default (stateless design; review resume re-invokes from the manifest) with opt-in `SqliteSaver` via `MAILROOM_CHECKPOINTER=sqlite`.

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose -f src/config/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres clickhouse langfuse-server   # OPTIONAL: Langfuse tracing only
cp .env.example .env
pip install -e ".[dev]"
PYTHONPATH=src python -m api.main &
# optional dedicated watcher when MAILROOM_EMBED_WATCHER=0:
# PYTHONPATH=src python -m pipeline.watcher &
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/upload -F "file=@src/tests/fixtures/contract/sample_msa.txt" -F "matter_id=MATTER-001"
```

## The Mailroom Umbrella

The whole constellation lives in one **monorepo** — **[mailroom-dev](https://github.com/Exios66/mailroom-dev)** — a single `uv` workspace holding every family repo as a git-subtree package (`packages/llm-mailroom` ⇄ this repo), with a hub task board (`governance/TASKS.md`) and a sub-package sync driver (`scripts/sync_packages.py status|pull|push`). Cross-repo development happens there; release builds keep running from this standalone repo.

Mailroom is the pipeline at the center of that governed constellation: **[llm-entity-extraction](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-entity-extraction)** (the prompt-experiment loop that breeds its sorter/specialist prompts, sharing one kanban board), **[llm-dojo-scoring](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-dojo-scoring)** (the pinned scoring engine, `v0.14.0`), corpus feeds **[Enron-Evaluation-Environment](https://github.com/Exios66/Enron-Evaluation-Environment)** (correspondence) and **[claims-data-eda](https://github.com/Exios66/claims-data-eda)** (insurance claims, candidate), eval sibling **[atticus-investigation](https://github.com/Exios66/atticus-investigation)** (LegalBench), the downstream visualizer **[The-Mailroom](https://github.com/Exios66/The-Mailroom)** (pixel-art document conveyor + hosted Observatory Space, driven solely by this repo's Langfuse traces; Inbox and REVIEW resolve need this API as `MAILROOM_PIPELINE_URL`), and the derived knowledge-graph site **[llm-mailroom-graph](https://exios66.github.io/llm-mailroom-graph/)**. Full map: [docs/sister-repos.md](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/docs/sister-repos.md).
