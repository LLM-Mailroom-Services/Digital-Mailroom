"""Load environment variables from a .env file.

The app reads its configuration from environment variables (LLM keys, database
URL, observability keys, pipeline paths). A local `.env` file lets you keep those
in one place. Call `load_env()` early in any process entrypoint (watcher, API,
ops monitor) or standalone script.

`load_dotenv()` never overrides variables that are already set in the real
environment, so exported vars always win over the `.env` file.
