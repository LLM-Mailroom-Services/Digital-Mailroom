# VENDORED from github.com/Exios66/llm-entity-extraction (verified against
# commit 3a03d5c, 2026-08-10 — issue #10 alignment check: CONTRACT_SUBTYPES,
# _SUBTYPE_ALIASES, SUBTYPE_EQUIVALENCES, SORTER_SCHEMA, DOC_CLASSES, and the
# sorter_v5 prompt are byte-identical to upstream; the only divergences are the
# MAILROOM PATCHes below and the corrected 4-tuple return annotation, which
# matches upstream's actual return value — upstream declares a stale
# ``tuple[str, float, str]`` but returns (doc_type, subtype, confidence,
# reasoning)).
# Imported verbatim (import paths rewritten to ``langchain_agents.*``) so the
# eval-validated LangChain sorter/contracts-specialist agents run inside the
# mailroom. Local adaptations (pages/vision, usage/deadline hooks) are marked
# ``MAILROOM PATCH``. Keep diffs against upstream small and documented.
