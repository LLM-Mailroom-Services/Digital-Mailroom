"""Production pipeline doctrine appended onto frozen predecessor prompts.

Each fragment is a smallest-testable mutation targeting a named failure class
observed in the mailroom pipeline (unknown-type remapping, missing CUAD
subtype, numeric-zero treated as empty, mixed-class false conflicts, vision
subtracting text, schema-field drift). Predecessors stay byte-identical;
new production versions are pure appends of these blocks.

Do not put Mustache placeholders (`{{...}}`) here — only the sorter base
carries injected taxonomy variables.
