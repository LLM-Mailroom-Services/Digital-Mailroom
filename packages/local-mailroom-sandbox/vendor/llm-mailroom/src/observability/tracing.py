"""Observability facade — picks the active tracing backend.

Backend selection (env `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER`):

  auto        (default) langfuse if LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY is set, else braintrust
              if BRAINTRUST_API_KEY is set, else phoenix (local, free)
  langfuse    force Langfuse
  braintrust  force Braintrust
  phoenix     force Arize Phoenix (local OpenTelemetry, cost-free)
  none        disable tracing entirely

The ``auto`` chain is aligned with ``llm-entity-extraction``'s architecture:
cloud backends (Langfuse/Braintrust) win when their keys are set, otherwise
tracing falls through to the **local, cost-free Arize Phoenix** backend instead
of silently disabling. This keeps every LLM call traced with zero spend on top
of the API calls.

Two integration points:

- `instrument_openai_client` wraps the OpenAI client built in
  `llm/client.py:get_llm`, so every LLM call becomes a traced generation.
- `pipeline_trace` / `traced_node` add structured, nested observations around
  document runs and graph nodes (Langfuse-only structured spans; the
  Phoenix/Braintrust backends still trace LLM calls). All helpers no-op safely
  when tracing is disabled.
