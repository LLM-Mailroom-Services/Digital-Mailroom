"""P1 evaluation-contract derivations (plan §86, HUB-022).

Pure, deterministic derivations of the Mailroom evaluation-hardening ground
truth for every ``mailroom-dataset`` row, per the §84A dependency chain
(document_id → annotation_provenance → confidence-band/calibration fixtures;
failure/review/retry expectations → P3 fixtures). Every derivation is a pure
function of the row (+ the pipeline's taxonomy.yaml for specialist routing);
absence is ``''`` (the corpus-wide convention — verified: zero true NULLs).

Fields (§45/§58/§59/§31/§43):

- ``expected_specialist`` (§59) — from the canonical class × specialist
  mapping read out of llm-mailroom's ``taxonomy.yaml`` (the same registry the
  parity gate validates); ``merger_agreement`` stays a distinct class that
  routes to ``contracts_specialist`` (§6/§81).
- ``expected_stage`` (§57–58) — pipeline terminal expectation. The live
  pipeline's terminal stages are ``archived`` / ``review`` / ``failed``
  (``pipeline.bins.TERMINAL_MANIFEST_STAGES``); every canonical GT row is a
  well-formed five-class document, so the expected terminal stage is
  ``archived`` unless a fixture row overrides it (review/retry fixtures set
  ``review_expected=True`` and may expect ``review``).
- ``review_expected`` / ``review_reason`` (§31) — False/``''`` for canonical
  rows; the reason vocabulary is closed (§73).
- ``retry_expected`` / ``expected_post_retry_state`` (§31/§74) — same
  pattern; post-retry states come from the terminal stages.
- ``annotation_provenance`` (§43) — per-row: source, method, model,
  prompt_version, confidence, reviewer, timestamp. Derived from the row's
  EXISTING provenance columns (``intent_source`` → §20 regime; class/subclass
  labels are source_native by construction — the v7 builder derives them
  from the source corpora, not from an annotator).

Deriving these does NOT publish anything: like ``identity.py``, this is the
v0.2-mailroom-hardened groundwork (§84) verified by the §63 contract tests
without pushing a new revision.
