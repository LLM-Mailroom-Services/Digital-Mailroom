"""Guard the evidence-based confidence calibration rule in agent prompts.

The sorter and every specialist must instruct the model to derive its
`confidence` score from the evidence in the current document (fields found,
nulls, truncation, ambiguity) and never anchor on a fixed high value such as
0.90/0.95. Without these rules the models default to round high scores, which
defeats the confidence-threshold routing in graph/routing.py.
