"""Per-agent SKILL FILES for the vendored LangChain agents.

Each designated agent gets its own reference material — domain knowledge that
lives OUTSIDE the eval-validated prompt text so the versioned prompts stay
byte-stable (issue #10) while the agent's working context can grow.

Layout: ``langchain_agents/skills/<agent_name>/*.md`` — one file per topic.
Every file in an agent's skills dir is appended to its system prompt as a
``## Skill reference: <topic>`` section (below the base prompt), so the agent
can use the knowledge without changing the eval-validated core.

The sorter ships with:
  - ``cuad-subtypes.md`` — the 25 CUAD agreement families, the paper's folder
    taxonomy, and the equivalence classes (reseller<->distributor, ...) that
    the subtype evaluation historically confused.
  - ``confidence-calibration.md`` — when to be decisive vs flag for review.

The contracts specialist ships with:
  - ``contract-clauses.md`` — the 41 CUAD clause categories and the extraction
    schema's field expectations per agreement family.

Mailroom BaseAgent roles (reviewer, arbiter, boss, judge, remaining
specialists, reporter, transcribers) also drop skill files here; ``BaseAgent``
appends them below the managed prompt so Langfuse prompt linking stays on
the versioned head.

Adding a skill = dropping a ``.md`` file in the agent's directory; the
``load_skills()`` loader picks it up at process start (no code change).
