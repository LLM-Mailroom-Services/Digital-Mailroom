"""Correspondence subclass taxonomy + heuristic labeler for the Enron corpus.

The second-level ``expected_subclass`` dimension for the mailroom's
``correspondence`` doc class. The key set is DATA-NECESSITATED: it was
derived from the actual Enron corpus contents (subject-prefix clusters,
body markers, sender classes, MIME shapes) so that every correspondence in
the corpus maps to a key — ``email`` is the default for ordinary mail and
``other`` only catches genuinely unparseable/non-email files.

Keys:

- ``email``            — ordinary email correspondence (default for parseable mail)
- ``memo``             — interoffice memoranda (MEMORANDUM header blocks, TO/FROM/DATE/RE layouts)
- ``letter``           — formal letters (salutation/sign-off letter forms)
- ``notice``           — formal notices (litigation hold, termination, notice of ...)
- ``demand``           — demands / demand letters (payment, cease-and-desist, default)
- ``attorney_demand``  — demands sent by an attorney or law firm (the attorney-demand class)
- ``press_release``    — press/news releases distributed over email
- ``meeting_request``  — calendar invitations / meeting requests
- ``other``            — unparseable / not an email message; also the HUB-041
  fallback for voicemail transcriptions (voicemail abolished from the
  canonical taxonomy — 0 rows by construction, #66 adjudication)

Labeling is deterministic (pure function of the index row) so rebuilds and
the spot-check sample agree byte-for-byte.
